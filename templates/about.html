                SeatGeek is a third-party ticket platform that enables users to buy and sell previously purchased tickets
                for live sports, concerts, and theater events. Unfortunately, SeatGeek currently lacks the option for users
                to set up alerts for price fluctuations of tickets for a given event. That's where SeatGeek Alerts comes in
                â€“ a user-friendly and simple to use application that allows you to track your favourite events.
